# Space Invaders
A space invaders themed game written in C++ using SFML 2.4.1

This was my first ever application that I was pretty much proud of, even though there are quite a lot of hacks in the code.
If I were to work on this project again, (beside fixing the hacks and writing cleaner code) I'd also add a base Unit class, from which I could derive the Enemy and Player class.
